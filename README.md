To complete this game, I used:
- HTML6
- CSS3
- JavaScript ES6
- jQuery
- AJAX
- Git, Github and version control

Some of the user stories used to create the game are:
- I would like to sign up to play.
- I would like to sign up, and play without having to sign in again.
- I would like to be able to sign in to play.
- I would like to change my password.
- I would like to sign out when I am finished.
- I would like to play as player X or as player O.
- I would like the number of games I have played to display on the screen.
- I would like to play, and to win the game.

The game, as a whole, has been both easier and more difficult than I expected. Some aspects, such as the basic layout, and the authorization portion of the API, came very naturally. Others, such as the utilization of JavaScript to manipulate both DOM and elements defined by myself, have been like pulling teeth. At a point I felt a unity with my game, where I understood the complexity of it and how I would make it work, which were offset by the number of times I felt very baffled.

If i had an unlimited time period, I would clean up the code and the separation of concerns, first and foremost. While it flows naturally to me, it is only because I have had more eyes on it than I care to remember. I feel like cleaning it up would make it easier to read, correct, manipulate, and add to. Had I planned better at the outset, and separated everything earlier in the process, I may have run into less issues down the road.

Thanks for taking the time,
Pete
